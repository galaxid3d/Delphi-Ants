# Delphi-Ants
Game "Ants" start create by 04.2017

Purpose of the game: build an anthill of a given size. To do this, you need to collect parts for the anthill using worker ants.
#### Ants specialization
*   Scout-ants find anthill details on the field and detect enemies.
*   Worker-ants go to the nearest part of the anthill and then carry it to the anthill.
*   Defender-ants stand in a ring around the anthill and attack enemies if they are in range, if enemies are already attacking the anthill itself and the ant-queen.
*   Female-ant replaces the queen if she is killed.
*   Medics-ant heals the defender ants within their reach.
*   Queen-ant produces a given type of ant.
*   The enemies run to the anthill and attack it first, when it is destroyed they attack the queen.

You can play as any type of ant or enemies. When playing as the ant queen, the anthill itself and all the other ants will move behind you - they are your retinue! ;)
